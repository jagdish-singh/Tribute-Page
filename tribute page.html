    <div>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-direction: column">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br>to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up  more money. Works in the Civilian<br>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br>them.", he said."All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Marget Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakeman, he returns to school study under<br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br>rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br>to control malaria, disinfections, and other applied science.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a PH.D in genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br>yields</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> -Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br>sorghum yields</li>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br>that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br>we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
